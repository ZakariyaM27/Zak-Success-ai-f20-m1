    "Exercise 1.2: When something is wrong with your code, Python will raise errors. Often these will be \"syntax errors\" that signal that something is wrong with the form of your code (e.g., the code in the previous exercise raised a SyntaxError). There are also \"runtime errors\", which signal that your code was in itself formally correct, but that something went wrong during the code's execution. A good example is the ZeroDivisionError, which indicates that you tried to divide a number by zero (which, as you may know, is not allowed). Try to make Python raise such a ZeroDivisionError."
